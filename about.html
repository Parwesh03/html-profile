<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Parwesh Mohammed, an Electronics and Communication Engineering graduate from Coimbatore Institute of Technology with a strong interest in embedded systems, IoT, and drone technologies. 
  During my academic journey, I worked on several hands-on projects involving microcontrollers and wireless communication, which sparked my passion for technology-driven problem solving.
  I've developed a solid foundation in Python and C programming, and I'm actively enhancing my skills through platforms like LeetCode and YouTube tutorials. Beyond academics,
  I'm an active team player with strong communication skills, and I enjoy applying logical thinking in both technical tasks and team activities. My goal is to grow in a dynamic tech environment
   where I can contribute meaningfully while continuously learning.</p>
